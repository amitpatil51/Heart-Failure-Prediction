# 🫀 Heart Failure Risk Prediction

A **machine learning web application** built with **Streamlit** to predict the risk of death events caused by **heart failure**, based on clinical patient data.

This project combines **data preprocessing**, **model training**, and an interactive **web interface** to demonstrate how predictive analytics can assist in healthcare decision-making.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The notebook (`Heart Failure Prediction.ipynb`) contains the entire machine learning workflow — from data exploration and cleaning to model training and evaluation.

The Streamlit app (`app.py`) serves as a user-friendly interface that takes clinical inputs and predicts whether a patient is **at high or low risk of heart failure** using the trained model (`ultimate_model.pkl`).
